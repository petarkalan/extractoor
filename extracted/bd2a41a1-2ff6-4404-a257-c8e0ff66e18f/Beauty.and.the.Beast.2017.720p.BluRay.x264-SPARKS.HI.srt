- Good thinking, Cogsworth.
- What?

729
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,696
That's the most
ridiculous idea...

730
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,836
I've ever heard.
Charm the prisoner!

731
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,673
But you must try, Master.
With every passing day...

732
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,791
we become less human.

733
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,195
She's the daughter
of a common thief.

734
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,976
What kind of person do you
think that makes her?

735
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,831
Oh, you can't judge people...

736
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,150
by who their father is,
now can you?

737
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,198
You'll join me for dinner.

738
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,679
That's not a request.

739
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,159
Gently, Master.

740
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,793
The girl lost her father...

741
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,677
and her freedom in one day.

742
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,513
Yes, the poor thing is probably in there,
scared to death.

743
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,829
MRS. POTTS: Exactly.

744
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,192
Just a minute.

745
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,756
You see? There she is.
Now, remember, be gentle.

746
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,831
- Kind!
- Charming!

747
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,716
Sweet!

748
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,199
And when she opens the door,

749
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,078
give her a dashing,
debonair smile.

750
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,519
Come, come. Show me the smile.

751
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,189
- Oh, mon dieu!
- Oh, no.

752
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,029
Will you join me for dinner?

753
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,352
You've taken me
as your prisoner

754
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,715
and now you want
to have dinner with me?

755
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,554
Are you insane?

756
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,396
- (GRUNTING)
- Uh-oh. He's losing it.

757
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,919
Oh, dear!

758
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,790
I told you
to join me for dinner.

759
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,399
And I told you no.

760
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,114
Ooh! What time is it?

761
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,355
What's happening?

762
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,512
I'd starve before
I ever ate with you.

763
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,868
Well, be my guest.

764
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,712
Go ahead and starve.

765
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,199
If she doesn't eat with me...

766
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,713
then she doesn't eat at all.

767
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,709
Idiots!

768
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,674
You can't talk to us
like that. I forbid it.

769
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,753
Uh... Oh. Am I too late?

770
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,434
Shame, I was really going to
tell him off this time.

771
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,670

that most troubles
seem less troubling...

you did for your father, dearie.

Yes.

806

We all think so.

807

I'm worried about him.

808
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,034
He's never been on his own.

809
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,912
Cheer up, my poppet.

in the end.

after dinner.

813
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,238
But he said,
"If she doesn't eat with me,

814
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,719
then she doesn't eat at all."

a lot of things in anger.

whether or not to listen.

everyone! Tout de suite!

No, you don't!

you violated his orders

822
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,079

823
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,559
Yes, I will make sure of it.

824
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,358

stand up to him?

I am telling you,
this girl is the one.

826
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,520
They must fall in love
if we are to be human again...

827
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,760
and how can they fall in love
if she stays in her room?

Hey, Chapeau,
you missed a spot.

829

she'll never love him.

It was her cruelest trick of all.

It was just another curse.

MAN: Rising in the east

1983
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:27,759

MAN: Song as old as rhyme

1985

1986
02:05:36,920 --> 02:05:39,639
WOMAN: Tale as old as time

1987
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:42,832
MAN: Song as old as rhyme

1988
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:49,997
BOTH: Beauty and the Beast

1989
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:22,189
MAN: (SINGING)
I was the one who had it all

1990
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,353
I was the master of my fate

1991
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,630
I never needed anybody in my life

1992
02:06:32,800 --> 02:06:37,351
I learned the truth too late

1993
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,911
I'll never shake away the pain

1994
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:46,991
I close my eyes but she's still there

1995
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:51,830
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

1996
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:57,592
It's more than I can bear

1997
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:03,319
Now I know
she 'll never leave me

1998
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:07,951
Even as she runs away

1999
02:07:08,120 --> 02:07:12,716
She will still torment me
Calm me, hurt me

2000
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,873
Move me, come what may

2001
02:07:17,440 --> 02:07:21,797
Wasting in my lonely tower

2002
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:26,829
Waiting by an open door

2003
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,319
I'll fool myself
she'll walk right in

2004
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:37,593
And be with me for evermore

2005
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:43,314
I rage against the trials of love

2006
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,913
I curse the fading of the light

2007
02:07:48,280 --> 02:07:52,592
Though she's already flown
So far beyond my reach

2008
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:58,797
She's never out of sight

2009
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,636
Now I know she'll never leave me

2010
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:08,352
Even as she fades from view

2011
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:11,034
She will still inspire me

2012
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:16,837
Be a part of everything I do

2013
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:21,998
Wasting in my lonely tower

2014
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:27,116
Waiting by an open door

2015
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:30,955
I'll fool myself she 'll walk right in

2016
02:08:31,760 --> 02:08:35,389
And as the long, long nights begin

2017
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:39,914
I'll think of all that might have been

2018
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:47,077
Waiting here for evermore
